<h2>The good</h2>
<p>The validity of the design style has been hotly debated, which is to be expected, as, in a sense, the intent
    of Web Brutalism is to elicit a visceral reaction in the user. Some designers argue that the brash and
    brazen aesthetic is a much needed wake up call as the internet sleepwalks into a malaise of prosaic
    homogeny, allowing us to critically engage with and confront the zeitgeist and future of discipline as a
    whole. It has even been argued that unintuitive and idiosyncratic means of visual communication can
    ironically force the user to engage fully in order to comprehend the content, allowing for more effective
    delivery of content.</p>
<h2>The bad</h2>
<p class="c6"><span>However, other practitioners have rejected the notion of Web Brutalism as progress,
        lambasting it on grounds of accessibility, user experience, inclusivity, and aesthetics. The

        narcissistic endeavour, as the graphic designer pushes their own personal aesthetic at the expense of
        the user, as if the website were a piece of art. This is reflected in the fact that brutalist websites
        are disproportionately portfolio websites.</span></p>
