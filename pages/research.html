<p>Using Google’s <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a> tool I compared analysis
    of Brutalist websites and with websites from the Alexa
    Ranking list (most popular websites by number of users).</p>

<small>Alexa Rankings taken from <a href="https://www.wmtips.com/top/alexa-rank/">wmtips.com</a>, edited to
    exclude pornographic websites and duplicates. Brutalist website list taken from <a

<h2>Visual communication study</h2>
<p>I built on research from Fernando Suárez-Carballo from his paper <i>The Visual Language of Brutalist Web
        Design</i>, comparing data with websites from the Alexa Ranking to provide more perspective.</p>
<h3>Activity</h3>
<div class="chart"><img alt="Activity chart" src="img/charts/activity.png" /></div><small>Activity-passivity: In
    a two-dimensional and static space dynamism or the sensation of movement can be achieved (through diagonals,
    distortions, saturated colours or typographical contrast): in short, activity. At the other extreme,
    passivity seeks to transmit a sensation of absolute repose. It is usually linked to techniques with similar
    objectives, like neutrality, reticence or economy, among others.</small>
<h3>Balance</h3>
<div class="chart"><img alt="Balance chart" src="img/charts/balance.png" /></div><small>Symmetry-asymmetry:
    These are really two formulas to represent balance. While symmetrical balance is the static formula par
    excellence, asymmetry is obtained when the elements move away from the axis and give way to new
    relationships of more dynamic forces. Symmetry and asymmetry (as alternatives therefore to static and
    dynamic equilibrium respectively) and instability (the absence of balance) constitute therefore three
    options for representing the distribution of forces from levelling or sharpening.</small>
<h3>Coherence</h3>
<div class="chart"><img alt="Coherence chart" src="img/charts/coherence.png" /></div><small>Coherence-variation:
    In coherence, the elements are governed by one and the same formal criterion and some uniform visual
    features. Its opposite, variation, is the technique whose elements admit original changes and
    modifications.</small>
<h3>Continuity</h3>
<div class="chart"><img alt="Continuity chart" src="img/charts/countinuity.png" /></div>
<small>Continuity-episodicity: Continuity is defined by the existence of links and connections between the
    elements. In episodicity there is no proximity between the pieces, whose individual nature is reinforced by
    the dispersion of the parts.</small>
<h3>Depth</h3>
<div class="chart"><img alt="Depth chart" src="img/charts/flatness.png" /></div><small>Depth-flatness: On
    two-dimensional surfaces depth offers a three-dimensional sense, while flatness refers to the total absence
    of perspective in a composition. They are usually the basic criteria of visual trends such as skeuomorphism
    and flat design, respectively.</small>
<h3>Greyscale</h3>
<div class="chart"><img alt="Greyscale chart" src="img/charts/greyscale.png" /></div><small>Use of greyscale
    colour palette.</small>
<h3>Regularity</h3>
<div class="chart"><img alt="Regularity chart" src="img/charts/regularity.png" /></div>
<small>Regularity-Irregularity: Compositional regularity is based on uniformity and homogeneity of the elements
    which make up the piece. Visual resolution is organised, following a pre-established pattern, and usually
    stems from a uniform space via a clearly defined grid. Irregularity is based, on the other hand, on
    diversity and on a visible plan of distribution to reinforce the surprising, unusual and dynamic
    feature.</small>
<h3>Sequentiality</h3>
<div class="chart"><img alt="Sequentiality chart" src="img/charts/sequentiality.png" /></div>
<small>Sequentiality-randomness: Sequentiality seeks to establish a logical order or rhythmic pattern from the
    elements and is usually used to explain developments or changes. In a given visual composition it is a
    synonym of hierarchy. Randomness, however, suggests a certain disorganisation of the elements.</small>
<h3>Sharpness</h3>
<div class="chart"><img alt="Sharpness chart" src="img/charts/sharpness.png" /></div>
<small>Sharpness-diffusiveness: Sharpness strengthens the outlines and fixes the composition through definition,
    clarity and precision of the units’ features. Diffusiveness aims for a softer or more blurred definition of
    the elements.</small>
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<div class="chart"><img alt="Simplicity chart" src="img/charts/simplicity.png" /></div>
<small>Simplicity-complexity: Simplicity seeks an immediate, clear and direct solution, free of superfluous
    elements and useless additions. Complexity, on the other hand, is created through the use of numerous units
    and elements (usually) and from an implausible structure which gives rise to intricate visual
    schemata.</small>
<h3>Singularity</h3>
<div class="chart"><img alt="Singularity chart" src="img/charts/singularity.png" /></div>
<small>Singularity-juxtaposition: Singularity is a composition based on the absolute protagonism of one of its
    components which eclipses the others and forms the main point of the message. Juxtaposition, for its part,
    is based on the complementarity of two or more of the composition’s units which contain similar relevance
    and acquire a mutual dependency in order to give meaning to the image.</small>
<h3>Webfonts</h3>

    webfonts.</small>
