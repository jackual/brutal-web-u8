<h1>The Internet is a Brutal Place</h1>
<h2>An introduction to the Brutalist Internet</h2>
<p>Brutalist Web Design, or Web Brutalism, is a web design movement that emerged in the mid 2010s. The
    controversial, avant-garde design style breaks away from the polished, UX-focused landscape of
    contemporary
    web
    design, instead embracing a raw, unrefined aesthetic. As with the eponymous architectural style, Web
    Brutalism
    exposes and celebrates the underlying material and structure of web pages, prioritising function over
    form.
    This
    approach strips away the superficial layers of design to highlight the essential, often disregarded
    aspects
    of
    web construction.</p>
<p>While Web Brutalism permeated blogs and the media, with a 2016 Washington Post headline claiming that
    “the
    hottest trend in Web design is making intentionally ugly, difficult sites”, in-depth analysis on the
    movement is
    scarce. This website aims to outline the motifs, ethos, and debate surrounding the much maligned
    movement,
    as
    well as using data and original research to investigate these claims.</p>
