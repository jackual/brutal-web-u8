        <h2>An introduction to the Brutalist Internet</h2>
        <p>Brutalist Web Design, or Web Brutalism, is a web design movement that emerged in the mid 2010s. The
            controversial, avant-garde design style breaks away from the polished, UX-focused landscape of contemporary
            web
            design, instead embracing a raw, unrefined aesthetic. As with the eponymous architectural style, Web
            Brutalism
            exposes and celebrates the underlying material and structure of web pages, prioritising function over form.
            This
            approach strips away the superficial layers of design to highlight the essential, often disregarded aspects
            of
            web construction.</p>
        <p>While Web Brutalism permeated blogs and the media, with a 2016 Washington Post headline claiming that “the
            hottest trend in Web design is making intentionally ugly, difficult sites”, in-depth analysis on the
            movement is
            scarce. This website aims to outline the motifs, ethos, and debate surrounding the much maligned movement,
            as
            well as using data and original research to investigate these claims.</p>

        <h2>Defining the movement</h2>
        <p>Brutalism is an architectural style that emerged in mid-20th century postwar Britain, characterised by
            simple,
            geometric forms, repetitive grids and modules, and raw concrete construction. The term was coined by
            Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, deriving from the French <i style="font-style: italic;">béton brut</i>,
            meaning raw concrete, but also
            humorously alluding to the poor reception of Brutalism in the UK. Like its architectural counterpart, Web
            Brutalism adopts geometric rigidity and exposes the 'raw concrete' of web development—the underlying code
            and
            markup that are typically hidden beneath layers of stylistic embellishments. This homage extends into the
            web
            medium through a design language that values honesty and utilitarianism, stripping away the non-essential to
            foreground the website’s fundamental structure and purpose.</p>
        <p>In translating these motifs to the digital realm, Brutalist Web Design manifests primarily in two distinct
            and
            seemingly antithetical interpretations, which I will refer to as minimalist and non-minimalist. The
            minimalist
            approach focuses on extreme reductionism, consisting of bare-bones HTML and CSS, evoking the totally
            unadorned
            and unsentimental nature of Brutalist buildings. Conversely, the non-minimalist approach, reminiscent of
            opts
            for a cacophony of haphazardly placed elements, abrasive typography, and harsh colours, actively rebelling
            against user experience and legibility. Both interpretations share a common disdain for the sleek, polished
            aesthetics of contemporary web design, yet they diverge in their methods of expressing the core principles
            of
            Brutalism.</p>

        <h2>How did we get here</h2>
        <p class="c6"><span>The ethos of Web Brutalism mirrors the unpretentious and anti-bourgeois values of its
                architectural namesake. Popular content management systems (CMS) and frameworks like WordPress and

                which lead to the recycling of common design patterns and layouts, and design standards set by tech
                giants,
                such as </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://m3.material.io/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715340015002297&amp;usg=AOvVaw0JtKMtflTlld2KYTDuc_Ge">Google’s

                    Human Interface Guidelines</a></span><span class="c1">, are seen as emblematic of a commercial push
                towards a standardised, user-friendly web that Web Brutalism inherently resists, harking back to the
                infancy
                of web design. UX design is an objective science, not an art form or visual design language, steering
                design
                decisions based on qualitative and quantitative data rather than creative impetus. Web Brutalism
                delights in
                the opposite—using non-standard navigation and a lack of information hierarchy, essentially turning the
                web
                experience into a form of art that challenges the user rather than accommodating them.</span></p>
        <marquee>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</marquee>
        <h2>The good</h2>
        <p>The validity of the design style has been hotly debated, which is to be expected, as, in a sense, the intent
            of Web Brutalism is to elicit a visceral reaction in the user. Some designers argue that the brash and
            brazen aesthetic is a much needed wake up call as the internet sleepwalks into a malaise of prosaic
            homogeny, allowing us to critically engage with and confront the zeitgeist and future of discipline as a
            whole. It has even been argued that unintuitive and idiosyncratic means of visual communication can
            ironically force the user to engage fully in order to comprehend the content, allowing for more effective
            delivery of content.</p>
        <h2>The bad</h2>
        <p class="c6"><span>However, other practitioners have rejected the notion of Web Brutalism as progress,
                lambasting it on grounds of accessibility, user experience, inclusivity, and aesthetics. The
                accessibility of brutalist websites </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dialectic/14932326.0001.107/--on-web-brutalism-and-contemporary-web-design?rgn%3Dmain;view%3Dfulltext&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715340015003080&amp;usg=AOvVaw0VVrcHDHmiZekSiJMOOV8F">has
                    been criticised</a></span><span class="c1">, particularly for disabled users and individuals from
                economically disadvantaged countries who are concerned with the download sizes of pages due to internet
                speeds and the price of data in relation to wages. However <a href="#original_research">my research</a>
                suggests that Brutalist websites,
                especially of the minimalist variety, on average outperform websites from the Alexa Ranking in terms of
                accessibility and weight (download size).</span></p>
        <h2>The ugly</h2>
        <p class="c6"><span>Brutalist websites are subjectively ugly, with </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://researchgate.net/publication/245965542_Do_Attractive_Things_Work_Better_An_Exploration_of_Search_Tool_Visualisations&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715340015003482&amp;usg=AOvVaw2qzzCOprwMs7ya5-OwjLc7">research</a></span><span>&nbsp;suggesting
                that attractive interfaces are perceived to be more effective, with users assessing said visual appeal
                in </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220208334_Attention_web_designers_You_have_50_milliseconds_to_make_a_good_first_impression_Behaviour_and_Information_Technology_252_115-126&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715340015003711&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zVcLgFsT13bIgLwGHk8Wv">50
                    milliseconds</a></span><span class="c1">. Choosing this design style could subjectively be seen as a
                narcissistic endeavour, as the graphic designer pushes their own personal aesthetic at the expense of
                the user, as if the website were a piece of art. This is reflected in the fact that brutalist websites
                are disproportionately portfolio websites.</span></p>

            Ranking list (most popular websites by number of users).</p>

                visual language of brutalist web design</a> by Fernando Suárez-Carballo.</small>
        <h2>Visual communication study</h2>
        <p>I built on research from Fernando Suárez-Carballo from his paper <i>The Visual Language of Brutalist Web
                Design</i>, comparing data with websites from the Alexa Ranking to provide more perspective.</p>
        <h3>Activity</h3>
        <div class="chart"><img alt="Activity chart" src="img/charts/activity.png" /></div><small>Activity-passivity: In
            a two-dimensional and static space dynamism or the sensation of movement can be achieved (through diagonals,
            distortions, saturated colours or typographical contrast): in short, activity. At the other extreme,
            passivity seeks to transmit a sensation of absolute repose. It is usually linked to techniques with similar
            objectives, like neutrality, reticence or economy, among others.</small>
        <h3>Balance</h3>
        <div class="chart"><img alt="Balance chart" src="img/charts/balance.png" /></div><small>Symmetry-asymmetry:
            These are really two formulas to represent balance. While symmetrical balance is the static formula par
            excellence, asymmetry is obtained when the elements move away from the axis and give way to new
            relationships of more dynamic forces. Symmetry and asymmetry (as alternatives therefore to static and
            dynamic equilibrium respectively) and instability (the absence of balance) constitute therefore three
            options for representing the distribution of forces from levelling or sharpening.</small>
        <h3>Coherence</h3>
        <div class="chart"><img alt="Coherence chart" src="img/charts/coherence.png" /></div><small>Coherence-variation:
            In coherence, the elements are governed by one and the same formal criterion and some uniform visual
            features. Its opposite, variation, is the technique whose elements admit original changes and
            modifications.</small>
        <h3>Continuity</h3>
        <div class="chart"><img alt="Continuity chart" src="img/charts/countinuity.png" /></div>
        <small>Continuity-episodicity: Continuity is defined by the existence of links and connections between the
            elements. In episodicity there is no proximity between the pieces, whose individual nature is reinforced by
            the dispersion of the parts.</small>
        <h3>Depth</h3>
        <div class="chart"><img alt="Depth chart" src="img/charts/flatness.png" /></div><small>Depth-flatness: On
            two-dimensional surfaces depth offers a three-dimensional sense, while flatness refers to the total absence
            of perspective in a composition. They are usually the basic criteria of visual trends such as skeuomorphism
            and flat design, respectively.</small>
        <h3>Greyscale</h3>
        <div class="chart"><img alt="Greyscale chart" src="img/charts/greyscale.png" /></div><small>Use of greyscale
            colour palette.</small>
        <h3>Regularity</h3>
        <div class="chart"><img alt="Regularity chart" src="img/charts/regularity.png" /></div>
        <small>Regularity-Irregularity: Compositional regularity is based on uniformity and homogeneity of the elements
            which make up the piece. Visual resolution is organised, following a pre-established pattern, and usually
            stems from a uniform space via a clearly defined grid. Irregularity is based, on the other hand, on
            diversity and on a visible plan of distribution to reinforce the surprising, unusual and dynamic
            feature.</small>
        <h3>Sequentiality</h3>
        <div class="chart"><img alt="Sequentiality chart" src="img/charts/sequentiality.png" /></div>
        <small>Sequentiality-randomness: Sequentiality seeks to establish a logical order or rhythmic pattern from the
            elements and is usually used to explain developments or changes. In a given visual composition it is a
            synonym of hierarchy. Randomness, however, suggests a certain disorganisation of the elements.</small>
        <h3>Sharpness</h3>
        <div class="chart"><img alt="Sharpness chart" src="img/charts/sharpness.png" /></div>
        <small>Sharpness-diffusiveness: Sharpness strengthens the outlines and fixes the composition through definition,
            clarity and precision of the units’ features. Diffusiveness aims for a softer or more blurred definition of
            the elements.</small>
        <h3>Simplicity</h3>
        <div class="chart"><img alt="Simplicity chart" src="img/charts/simplicity.png" /></div>
        <small>Simplicity-complexity: Simplicity seeks an immediate, clear and direct solution, free of superfluous
            elements and useless additions. Complexity, on the other hand, is created through the use of numerous units
            and elements (usually) and from an implausible structure which gives rise to intricate visual
            schemata.</small>
        <h3>Singularity</h3>
        <div class="chart"><img alt="Singularity chart" src="img/charts/singularity.png" /></div>
        <small>Singularity-juxtaposition: Singularity is a composition based on the absolute protagonism of one of its
            components which eclipses the others and forms the main point of the message. Juxtaposition, for its part,
            is based on the complementarity of two or more of the composition’s units which contain similar relevance
            and acquire a mutual dependency in order to give meaning to the image.</small>
        <h3>Webfonts</h3>
        <div class="chart"><img alt="Webfonts chart" src="img/charts/webfonts.png" /></div><small>Use of external
            webfonts.</small>
