        <h1>The Internet is a Brutal Place</h1>
        <h2>An introduction to the Brutalist Internet</h2>
        <p>Brutalist Web Design, or Web Brutalism, is a web design movement that emerged in the mid 2010s. The
            controversial, avant-garde design style breaks away from the polished, UX-focused landscape of contemporary
            web
            design, instead embracing a raw, unrefined aesthetic. As with the eponymous architectural style, Web
            Brutalism
            exposes and celebrates the underlying material and structure of web pages, prioritising function over form.
            This
            approach strips away the superficial layers of design to highlight the essential, often disregarded aspects
            of
            web construction.</p>
        <p>While Web Brutalism permeated blogs and the media, with a 2016 Washington Post headline claiming that “the
            hottest trend in Web design is making intentionally ugly, difficult sites”, in-depth analysis on the
            movement is
            scarce. This website aims to outline the motifs, ethos, and debate surrounding the much maligned movement,
            as
            well as using data and original research to investigate these claims.</p>
        <h1>Nothing concrete</h1>
        <h2>Defining the movement</h2>
        <p>Brutalism is an architectural style that emerged in mid-20th century postwar Britain, characterised by
            simple,
            geometric forms, repetitive grids and modules, and raw concrete construction. The term was coined by
            Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, deriving from the French <i style="font-style: italic;">béton brut</i>,
            meaning raw concrete, but also
            humorously alluding to the poor reception of Brutalism in the UK. Like its architectural counterpart, Web
            Brutalism adopts geometric rigidity and exposes the 'raw concrete' of web development—the underlying code
            and
            markup that are typically hidden beneath layers of stylistic embellishments. This homage extends into the
            web
            medium through a design language that values honesty and utilitarianism, stripping away the non-essential to
            foreground the website’s fundamental structure and purpose.</p>
        <p>In translating these motifs to the digital realm, Brutalist Web Design manifests primarily in two distinct
            and
            seemingly antithetical interpretations, which I will refer to as minimalist and non-minimalist. The
            minimalist
            approach focuses on extreme reductionism, consisting of bare-bones HTML and CSS, evoking the totally
            unadorned
            and unsentimental nature of Brutalist buildings. Conversely, the non-minimalist approach, reminiscent of
            opts
            for a cacophony of haphazardly placed elements, abrasive typography, and harsh colours, actively rebelling
            against user experience and legibility. Both interpretations share a common disdain for the sleek, polished
            aesthetics of contemporary web design, yet they diverge in their methods of expressing the core principles
            of
            Brutalism.</p>
        <h1>The web is so boring</h1>
        <h2>How did we get here</h2>
        <p class="c6"><span>The ethos of Web Brutalism mirrors the unpretentious and anti-bourgeois values of its
                architectural namesake. Popular content management systems (CMS) and frameworks like WordPress and
            </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dagusa.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715340015002083&amp;usg=AOvVaw2U4loOmbw1yEMW087vePaw">Bootstrap</a></span><span>,
                which lead to the recycling of common design patterns and layouts, and design standards set by tech
                giants,
                such as </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://m3.material.io/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715340015002297&amp;usg=AOvVaw0JtKMtflTlld2KYTDuc_Ge">Google’s
                    Material Design</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715340015002483&amp;usg=AOvVaw0vnmAVjvqktEc96lDRd0eE">Apple’s
                    Human Interface Guidelines</a></span><span class="c1">, are seen as emblematic of a commercial push
                towards a standardised, user-friendly web that Web Brutalism inherently resists, harking back to the
                infancy
                of web design. UX design is an objective science, not an art form or visual design language, steering
                design
                decisions based on qualitative and quantitative data rather than creative impetus. Web Brutalism
                delights in
                the opposite—using non-standard navigation and a lack of information hierarchy, essentially turning the
                web
                experience into a form of art that challenges the user rather than accommodating them.</span></p>
        <h1>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h1>
        <h2>The good</h2>
        <p>The validity of the design style has been hotly debated, which is to be expected, as, in a sense, the intent
            of Web Brutalism is to elicit a visceral reaction in the user. Some designers argue that the brash and
            brazen aesthetic is a much needed wake up call as the internet sleepwalks into a malaise of prosaic
            homogeny, allowing us to critically engage with and confront the zeitgeist and future of discipline as a
            whole. It has even been argued that unintuitive and idiosyncratic means of visual communication can
            ironically force the user to engage fully in order to comprehend the content, allowing for more effective
            delivery of content.</p>
        <h2>The bad</h2>
        <p class="c6"><span>However, other practitioners have rejected the notion of Web Brutalism as progress,
                lambasting it on grounds of accessibility, user experience, inclusivity, and aesthetics. The
                accessibility of brutalist websites </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dialectic/14932326.0001.107/--on-web-brutalism-and-contemporary-web-design?rgn%3Dmain;view%3Dfulltext&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715340015003080&amp;usg=AOvVaw0VVrcHDHmiZekSiJMOOV8F">has
                    been criticised</a></span><span class="c1">, particularly for disabled users and individuals from
                economically disadvantaged countries who are concerned with the download sizes of pages due to internet
                speeds and the price of data in relation to wages. However my research suggests that Brutalist websites,
                especially of the minimalist variety, on average outperform websites from the Alexa Ranking in terms of
                accessibility and weight (download size).</span></p>
        <h2>The ugly</h2>
        <p class="c6"><span>Brutalist websites are subjectively ugly, with </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://researchgate.net/publication/245965542_Do_Attractive_Things_Work_Better_An_Exploration_of_Search_Tool_Visualisations&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715340015003482&amp;usg=AOvVaw2qzzCOprwMs7ya5-OwjLc7">research</a></span><span>&nbsp;suggesting
                that attractive interfaces are perceived to be more effective, with users assessing said visual appeal
                in </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220208334_Attention_web_designers_You_have_50_milliseconds_to_make_a_good_first_impression_Behaviour_and_Information_Technology_252_115-126&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715340015003711&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zVcLgFsT13bIgLwGHk8Wv">50
                    milliseconds</a></span><span class="c1">. Choosing this design style could subjectively be seen as a
                narcissistic endeavour, as the graphic designer pushes their own personal aesthetic at the expense of
                the user, as if the website were a piece of art. This is reflected in the fact that brutalist websites
                are disproportionately portfolio websites.</span></p>
